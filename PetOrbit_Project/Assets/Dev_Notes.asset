  devNotes:
  - I wanna Add Camera movement to snap to the pet you select in the adoptoon center
    (DONE)
  - I dont know yet if the player should walk around in the game or not, or if they
    should even have a character.
  - For the spawning in adoption center, make a list of positions the pets get spawned
    at So ne need to hard code it like rn
  - Dont check for if the pet is selected but rather do it on  the kennel, that way
    the kennel can control its light and the pets actions
  -
